-- It is possible to query multiple tables
SELECT *
FROM orders
LIMIT 5;
 
SELECT *
FROM subscriptions
LIMIT 5;
 
SELECT * 
FROM customers
LIMIT 5;

-- It is possible to combine two tables using JOIN
SELECT *
FROM orders
JOIN customers
    ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id;

-- We can still filter the joined data tables
SELECT *
FROM orders
JOIN subscriptions
    ON orders.subscription_id = subscriptions.subscription_id
    WHERE description = 'Fashion Magazine';

-- Use LEFT JOIN to keep unmatched rows as NULL
SELECT *
FROM newspaper
LEFT JOIN online
    ON newspaper.id = online.id;

-- Use foreign keys to perform inner joins on tables
SELECT *
FROM classes
JOIN students
    ON classes.id = students.class_id;

-- Use CROSS JOIN to get all possible combinations
SELECT shirts.shirt_color,
    pants.pants_color
FROM shirts
CROSS JOIN pants;

-- We can use cross join together with conditions
SELECT month,
    COUNT(*)
FROM newspaper
CROSS JOIN months
WHERE start_month <= month AND end_month >= month
GROUP BY month;

-- Use UNION to stack two tables with same structure
SELECT *
FROM newspaper
UNION
SELECT *
FROM online;

-- Use WITH to assign name to a query and use it later
WITH previous_query AS (
    SELECT customer_id,
        COUNT(subscription_id) AS 'subscriptions'
    FROM orders
    GROUP BY customer_id
)

SELECT customers.customer_name,
    previous_query.subscriptions
FROM customers
JOIN previous_query
    ON customers.customer_id = previous_query.customer_id;
